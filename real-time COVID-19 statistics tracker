Problem 4: Real-Time COVID-19 Statistics Tracker
4Scenario:
You are developing a real-time COVID-19 statistics tracking application for a healthcare organization. The application should provide up-to-date information on COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths for a specified region.
Tasks:
1.	Model the data flow for fetching COVID-19 statistics from an external API and displaying it to the user.
2.	Implement a Python application that integrates with a COVID-19 statistics API (e.g., disease.sh) to fetch real-time data.
3.	Display the current number of cases, recoveries, and deaths for a specified region.
4.	Allow users to input a region (country, state, or city) and display the corresponding COVID-19 statistics.
Deliverables:
•	Data flow diagram illustrating the interaction between the application and the API.
•	Pseudocode and implementation of the COVID-19 statistics tracking application.
•	Documentation of the API integration and the methods used to fetch and display COVID-19 data.
•	Explanation of any assumptions made and potential improvements.

+---------------------+
The key steps are:
1.	The user inputs a region (country, state, or city) into the application.
2.	The application sends a request to the COVID-19 API to fetch the real-time statistics for the specified region.
3.	The COVID-19 API processes the request and returns the current case, recovery, and death data.
4.	The application receives the COVID-19 statistics and displays the information to the user.

Pseudocode:
import requests

def get_covid_stats(region):
    """
    Fetch COVID-19 statistics for the specified region from the API.
    """
    api_url = f"https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/countries/{region}"
    response = requests.get(api_url)
    data = response.json()
    
    cases = data["cases"]
    recoveries = data["recovered"]
    deaths = data["deaths"]
    
    return cases, recoveries, deaths

def display_covid_stats(cases, recoveries, deaths):
    """
    Display the COVID-19 statistics in a user-friendly format.
    """
    print(f"Current COVID-19 Statistics:")
    print(f"- Total Cases: {cases:,}")
    print(f"- Total Recoveries: {recoveries:,}")
    print(f"- Total Deaths: {deaths:,}")

def main():
    """
    Main function to handle user input and display COVID-19 statistics.
    """
    region = input("Enter a country, state, or city: ")
    cases, recoveries, deaths = get_covid_stats(region)
    display_covid_stats(cases, recoveries, deaths)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Detailed explanation of the actual code:
•	The application uses the requests library to make HTTP requests to the COVID-19 API provided by disease.sh. The get_covid_stats function takes a region (country, state, or city) as input and returns the current number of cases, recoveries, and deaths for that region.
•	The display_covid_stats function is responsible for formatting and printing the COVID-19 statistics in a user-friendly way. It takes the cases, recoveries, and deaths data as input and displays them with appropriate formatting (e.g., adding commas to large numbers).
•	The main function is the entry point of the application. It prompts the user to enter a region, calls the get_covid_stats function to fetch the data, and then passes the results to the display_covid_stats function to display the information.
Assumptions made (if any):
•	The application assumes that the disease.sh API is available and providing accurate real-time COVID-19 data.
•	The application assumes that the user will input a valid region (country, state, or city) that the API can recognize.
•	Potential Improvements:
•	Add error handling to the application to gracefully handle API errors or invalid user input.
•	Provide additional features, such as the ability to display historical COVID-19 data, trends, or visualizations.
•	Integrate the application with a user interface (e.g., a web application or a mobile app) to improve the user experience.
•	Allow users to select multiple regions and compare the COVID-19 statistics side-by-side.
•	Provide the ability to set alerts or notifications for significant changes in COVID-19 statistics.

Limitations:
1.	The API may have rate limits that restrict the number of requests.
2.	The data may not always be up-to-date due to delays in reporting.
3.	The application currently only handles countries; state and city-level queries may require additional endpoints.
