Problem 1: Real-Time Weather Monitoring System
Scenario:
You are developing a real-time weather monitoring system for a weather forecasting company. The system needs to fetch and display weather data for a specified location.
Tasks:
1.	Model the data flow for fetching weather information from an external API and displaying it to the user.
2.	Implement a Python application that integrates with a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch real-time weather data.
3.	Display the current weather information, including temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.
4.	Allow users to input the location (city name or coordinates) and display the corresponding weather data.
Deliverables:
•	Data flow diagram illustrating the interaction between the application and the API.
•	Pseudocode and implementation of the weather monitoring system.
•	Documentation of the API integration and the methods used to fetch and display weather data.
•	Explanation of any assumptions made and potential improvements.

Approach:
The data flow diagram illustrates the interaction between the application and the OpenWeatherMap API. The application receives user input for the location, fetches the weather data from the API, and displays the current weather information to the user.

Pseudocode:
# Function to fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
def fetch_weather_data(location):
    api_key = "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
    api_url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={location}&appid={api_key}"
    response = requests.get(api_url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        return data
    else:
        return None

# Function to display weather data to the user
def display_weather_data(data):
    if data:
        print(f"Current Weather in {data['name']}:")
        print(f"Temperature: {data['main']['temp']}°C")
        print(f"Weather Conditions: {data['weather'][0]['description']}")
        print(f"Humidity: {data['main']['humidity']}%")
        print(f"Wind Speed: {data['wind']['speed']} m/s")
    else:
        print("Error fetching weather data.")

# Main function to handle user input and display weather data
def main():
    location = input("Enter a city name or coordinates: ")
    data = fetch_weather_data(location)
    display_weather_data(data)

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Detailed explanation of the actual code:
1.	fetch_weather_data: This function takes a location as input and fetches the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It uses the requests library to send a GET request to the API with the location and API key. If the response is successful (200 status code), it parses the JSON response and returns the data. Otherwise, it returns None.
2.	display_weather_data: This function takes the weather data as input and displays the current weather information to the user. It prints the temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed if the data is available. If there is an error fetching the data, it prints an error message.
3.	main: This function handles user input and calls the fetch_weather_data and display_weather_data functions. It prompts the user to enter a location, fetches the weather data, and then displays the data to the user.
Assumptions made (if any):
1.	The user will always enter a valid location.
2.	The OpenWeatherMap API will always return data in the expected format.
Limitations:
1.	The application does not handle errors in the API response.
2.	It does not validate user input for location.
3.	It does not provide any additional features like historical weather data or weather forecasts.
